Just a cybersecurity devotee, currently pursuing my bachelor’s degree while immersing myself in the world of offensive security. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I’ve spent days and nights unraveling security challenges, and realized lately how much I want to preserve this journey, not just for others walking a similar path, but for my future self too. I regret not documenting my earlier struggles and accomplishments, but now I’m here to capture every mistake, lesson, breakthrough, and discovery in the form of technical write-ups and blogs, giving back to the community that is still teaching me a lot. 🫶
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">
Because it’s not just vulnerabilities we strive to find, it’s about the thought process we sometimes struggle to build, the approaches and directions we sometimes miss, and the “why” behind the problem that sometimes remains unrevealed. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When I’m not in cyber mode, you’ll probably find me absorbed in a gripping thriller, reflecting on human psychology, or learning about cultures far different from my own. Technology may connect us, but I believe it’s our shared stories that truly bring us closer. So, feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amna-emaan/" target="_blank" style="color: #0A66C2;">LinkedIn</a> — whether you want to exchange CTF strategies or recommend your favorite mind-bending series. 😊
